      <p>
        Le Wagon is a coding school founded in 2013 and run by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/bpapillard">Boris</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/romainpaillard">Romain</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ssaunier">SÃ©bastien</a>.
        <strong>Le Wagon's mission is to bring technical skills to creative people.</strong>
        Our 9-week bootcamp gives you the ability to build a prototype of any idea
        you might have. No technical background needed, just your motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= (@client.statistics['alumni']['total'] / 10) * 10 %>+ students already graduated from Le Wagon. They found positions as Junior Web Developers,
        Product Managers (who can code, huge!), Technical Sales, etc. Others started
        their company, raised money, built a team. Others got back to their
        old job with their new super powers.
